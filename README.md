Aim:
To write a C++ program that checks whether a given number is positive, negative, or zero.

Tools Used:

Programiz (Online C++ compiler)

Visual Studio Code (with C++ extension and GCC compiler)

Theory:
In C++, conditional statements like if, else if, and else are used to make decisions based on conditions. A number is said to be:

Positive if it is greater than 0

Negative if it is less than 0

Zero if it is exactly 0

Using a single if-else ladder, we can compare the input number and display the appropriate category.

Algorithm:

1.Start the program.

2.Declare an integer variable.

3.Prompt the user to enter a number.

4.Use cin to read the input.

5.Use if-else conditions to check:

6.If the number is greater than 0, display "Positive"

7.If less than 0, display "Negative"

Else, display "Zero"

8.End the program.

Conclusion:
The program was successfully written and executed. It determines whether an entered integer is positive, negative, or zero using conditional logic in C++
